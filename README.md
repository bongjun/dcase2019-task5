This repository contains code to build models for [DCASE 2019 Challange-task5 (Urban sound tagging)](http://dcase.community/challenge2019/task-urban-sound-tagging). Some scripts for manipulating the dataset and evaluating the model were taken from [the baseline code](https://github.com/sonyc-project/urban-sound-tagging-baseline) provided by the challange orginzers.

## Summary of the task
The goal is to predict whether each of 23 (fine-grained) or 8 (coarse grained) sources of noise pollution is present in a 10-second recording. This is a multi-label and multi-class classification probelem. My model only works for the 8 coarse-grained labels:
* Classes: engine, machinery-impact, non-machinery-impact, powered-saw, alert-signal, music, human-voice, and dog.
